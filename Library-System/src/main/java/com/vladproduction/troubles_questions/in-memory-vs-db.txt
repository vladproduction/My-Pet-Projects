Question? ->
it seems like correct relationship, but we still have a '0' for a author books after we call #8 action;
is it because we call a list of authors but not an information about each of authors?
if so, maybe we do not have to print number of books associated to each author?

Conclusion! ->
Books List: The books list within the Author class is meant to maintain the relationships of books associated with that author in memory.
However, this list isn’t automatically populated from the database when you retrieve author information.

Data Retrieval: The getAllAuthors() method fetches all authors from the database but does not include any logic
to also retrieve or populate the associated books for each author.
Thus, when you print the authors, the books size remains 0.

Options to Resolve This Issue:
1)Loading Associated Books:
  When retrieving authors, you can also consider fetching associated books as part of the query, or alternatively,
  load the author’s books based on their relationships directly after fetching the authors.

2)Separating the Display Logic:
  If you choose to only display the number of books, this would require ensuring that when an author
  is added or referenced, their book list is populated immediately.
