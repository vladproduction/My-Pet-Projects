    *** Explanation Main ***
    ------------------------
* Task Creation:
Instances of the task classes (NowTask, DelayTask, ScheduleTask, and RepeatedTask) are created with simple actions.

* Processing Tasks:
Each task is processed using an instance of TaskProcessor.
The processor executes the tasks and logs any potential errors using SLF4J.

* Sleep for Output:
The Thread.sleep(30000) statement is used to wait long enough for the scheduled and repeated tasks to run,
allowing you to see the output generated by those tasks.

* Graceful Shutdown:
After processing, it calls TaskProcessor.stopProcessing() to allow all scheduled tasks to complete before shutting down,
ensuring a clean exit of the application.


    *** Build Environment ***
    -------------------------
SLF4J and logging dependencies is necessary for work API correctly.


    *** Running the Program ***
    ---------------------------
Execute the Main class in your Java environment
(should demonstrate the expected behavior of each task type along with logging any errors encountered during execution)
