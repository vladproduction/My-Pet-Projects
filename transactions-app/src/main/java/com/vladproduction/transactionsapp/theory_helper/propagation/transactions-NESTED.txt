Context of transaction scenario, Spring will:
-----------------------
@BeanA (nested) --> @BeanB (required):
@BeanA (nested):
Requires a surrounding transaction to create its own nested transaction.
@BeanB (required):
Requires a surrounding transaction to participate in. If no transaction exists, it throws an exception.
Outcomes (depend on existing transaction):
Existing Transaction:
@BeanA Creates Nested Transaction: Within the context of the existing transaction, @BeanA can create its own nested transaction.
These nested transactions allow for finer-grained control over commit/rollback behavior within the larger transaction.
@BeanB Participates: Since a surrounding transaction exists (either the original or the one created by @BeanA),
@BeanB can participate in it.
No Existing Transaction:
Exception in @BeanA (likely): Because @BeanA (nested) requires a surrounding transaction to create its nested transaction,
it will likely throw an exception due to the absence of one (as @BeanA is called first).
@BeanB Not Reached (due to exception in @BeanA): Since @BeanA likely throws an exception, control won't flow to @BeanB.
Important Points:
This scenario can be exception-prone if no existing transaction exists.
The order of execution matters: @BeanA is called first and needs a surrounding transaction for its nested transaction.
@BeanB (required) strictly requires a transaction, which might not be available if @BeanA throws an exception.
Alternatives:
Consider required on both: If both methods require transactional behavior and you intend for @BeanA to create a nested
transaction, use required on both @BeanA and @BeanB. This ensures a new transaction is started if none exists.
Re-evaluate propagation levels:
If @BeanA doesn't necessarily need a nested transaction, consider supports on @BeanA (participates in existing or runs
non-transactionally).
If @BeanA must use nested but @BeanB can handle non-transactional execution in some cases, consider supports on @BeanB
instead. However, be mindful of data consistency concerns.
Explicit Transaction Management: If you need more control over transactions, consider managing the transaction explicitly
using a transaction manager. This allows you to define the transaction boundaries more precisely and start a transaction
before calling @BeanA to ensure it's available for its nested transaction.

-----------------------
@BeanA (nested) --> @BeanB (required_new):
@BeanA (nested):
Requires a surrounding transaction to create its own nested transaction.
@BeanB (required_new):
Forces a new, independent transaction named "Transaction Y" (or a newly generated name) even if a surrounding transaction
exists (including one potentially created by another method).
Outcomes:
Existing Transaction:
@BeanA Creates Nested Transaction: Within the context of the existing transaction, @BeanA can create its own nested transaction.
@BeanB Creates Its Own Independent Transaction ("Transaction Y"): Regardless of @BeanA's nested transaction, @BeanB forces
its own isolated transaction "Transaction Y".
No Existing Transaction:
@BeanA Creates New Top-Level Transaction (likely): Due to the absence of a surrounding transaction and @BeanA requiring
one for its nested transaction, @BeanA likely starts a new top-level transaction.
@BeanB Creates Its Own Independent Transaction ("Transaction Y"): Within the newly created top-level transaction (or even
if none exists), @BeanB still creates its own independent transaction "Transaction Y".
Important Points:
This scenario prioritizes @BeanB's isolation by creating its own independent transaction "Transaction Y" regardless of
@BeanA's nesting behavior or the presence of an existing transaction.
Alternatives:
Consider if @BeanA actually needs a nested transaction:
If @BeanA doesn't require a nested transaction and just needs to participate in a transaction, consider required on @BeanA.
If @BeanA's logic can be refactored to not rely on a nested transaction, this could simplify the scenario.
Explicit Transaction Management: If managing complex transactional behavior is crucial, consider explicitly managing
the transaction using a transaction manager. This allows you to define transaction boundaries more precisely and
potentially start a transaction before calling @BeanA (if needed for its nested transaction).

-----------------------
@BeanA (nested) --> @BeanB (mandatory):
@BeanA (nested):
Requires a surrounding transaction to create its own nested transaction.
@BeanB (mandatory):
Requires a surrounding transaction to participate in. If no transaction exists, it throws an exception.
Outcome (Exception Likely):
This scenario is prone to exceptions because @BeanA requires a surrounding transaction for its nested transaction,
while @BeanB also requires a surrounding transaction to participate in (but doesn't necessarily create its own nested one).
Reasons for Exception:
Order of Execution: @BeanA is called first and needs a surrounding transaction for its nested transaction.
Conflicting Requirements: If no existing transaction exists:
@BeanA might throw an exception due to the lack of a surrounding transaction.
Even if @BeanA manages to create a nested transaction (potentially starting a new top-level transaction), @BeanB
wouldn't be able to participate in it because mandatory requires a surrounding transaction at its own level, which might
not be available (depending on @BeanA's handling of the missing transaction).
Important Points:
This scenario can be exception-prone due to the mismatch between @BeanA's need for a surrounding transaction for nesting
and @BeanB's strict requirement for a surrounding transaction to participate in.
Alternatives:
Re-evaluate Propagation Levels:
If @BeanA doesn't necessarily require a nested transaction, consider required on @BeanA (participates in existing or
starts a new one).
If @BeanA must use nested but @BeanB can handle non-transactional execution in some cases, consider supports on @BeanB
instead (participates in existing or runs non-transactionally). However, be cautious of data consistency concerns.
Explicit Transaction Management: If managing complex transactional behavior is crucial, consider explicitly managing the
transaction using a transaction manager. This allows you to define transaction boundaries more precisely and start a
transaction before calling @BeanA to ensure it's available for its nested transaction.

-----------------------
@BeanA (nested) --> @BeanB (never):
@BeanA (nested):
Requires a surrounding transaction to create its own nested transaction.
@BeanB (never):
Never participates in a transaction, regardless of any existing transaction (including a potential nested transaction
from @BeanA). It executes outside of any transactional context.
Outcome:
@BeanA Behavior Depends on Existing Transaction:
Existing Transaction: If a surrounding transaction exists, @BeanA might create its own nested transaction within that larger
transaction (depending on how it handles the presence of an existing transaction).
No Existing Transaction: @BeanA's behavior depends on its implementation. It might throw an exception due to the missing
surrounding transaction or attempt to create a new top-level transaction (if allowed).
@BeanB Always Executes Non-Transactionally: Regardless of @BeanA's attempt at nesting or the presence of any transaction,
@BeanB will always execute outside of any transactional context.
Important Points:
There's a fundamental mismatch between @BeanA's attempt at nesting and @BeanB's avoidance of transactions entirely.
@BeanA's behavior might differ depending on how it handles the absence of a surrounding transaction.
Alternatives:
Re-evaluate @BeanA or @BeanB:
If @BeanA doesn't necessarily require a nested transaction, consider required on @BeanA (participates in existing or
starts a new one). This allows for simpler transaction management.
If @BeanB truly doesn't need to be transactional and its logic doesn't modify data accessed by transactional methods,
never might be suitable.
Explicit Transaction Management: If managing complex transactional behavior is crucial, consider explicitly managing
the transaction using a transaction manager. This allows you to define transaction boundaries more precisely and
potentially start a transaction before calling @BeanA (if needed for its nested transaction).

-----------------------
@BeanA (nested) --> @BeanB (supported):
@BeanA (nested):
Requires a surrounding transaction to create its own nested transaction.
@BeanB (supported):
If a surrounding transaction exists, it can participate in that existing transaction (depends on its logic).
If no surrounding transaction exists, @BeanB runs non-transactionally.
Outcomes (depend on existing transaction):
Existing Transaction:
@BeanA Creates Nested Transaction (likely): Within the context of the existing transaction, @BeanA can create its own
nested transaction. These nested transactions allow for finer-grained control over commit/rollback behavior within the larger
transaction.
@BeanB Participates (potentially): Since a surrounding transaction exists (either the original or the one created by @BeanA),
@BeanB can potentially participate in it depending on its logic.
No Existing Transaction:
@BeanA Behavior Depends on Implementation:
It might throw an exception due to the missing surrounding transaction needed for its nested transaction.
It might attempt to create a new top-level transaction (if allowed) to fulfill its nesting requirement.
@BeanB Executes Non-Transactionally: If @BeanA doesn't create a surrounding transaction (due to an exception or not being
allowed to start a new one), @BeanB will simply run non-transactionally.
Important Points:
The outcome hinges on whether an existing transaction exists.
@BeanA might throw an exception or attempt to create a new top-level transaction if no surrounding transaction exists.
@BeanB can potentially participate in a nested transaction created by @BeanA or run non-transactionally if no transaction
is available.
Alternatives:
Consider Consistency Needs: Ensure @BeanA's logic doesn't unintentionally affect data also accessed by transactional
methods if @BeanA throws an exception due to missing transactions.
Re-evaluate Propagation Levels:
If @BeanA doesn't necessarily require a nested transaction, consider required on @BeanA (participates in existing or starts
a new one) for simpler transaction management.
If @BeanA must have a nested transaction and @BeanB can handle non-transactional execution, consider supports on @BeanB.
However, be mindful of potential data consistency issues.
Explicit Transaction Management: If managing complex transactional behavior is crucial, consider explicitly managing the
transaction using a transaction manager. This allows you to define transaction boundaries more precisely and potentially
start a transaction before calling @BeanA to ensure it's available for its nested transaction.

-----------------------
@BeanA (nested) --> @BeanB (not_supported):
@BeanA (nested):
Requires a surrounding transaction to create its own nested transaction.
@BeanB (not_supported):
Never participates in a transaction, regardless of any existing transaction (including a potential nested transaction
from @BeanA). It executes outside of any transactional context.
Outcome (Exception Likely):
This scenario is prone to exceptions because @BeanA requires a surrounding transaction, while @BeanB specifically
avoids transactions entirely.
Reasons for Exception:
Order of Execution: @BeanA is called first and needs a surrounding transaction for its nested transaction.
Conflicting Requirements:
If no existing transaction exists: @BeanA likely throws an exception due to the lack of a surrounding transaction.
Even if @BeanA manages to create a nested transaction (potentially starting a new top-level transaction), @BeanB
wouldn't be able to participate in it because not_supported ensures it avoids any transactional context.
Important Points:
There's a fundamental mismatch between @BeanA's need for a surrounding transaction for nesting and @BeanB's avoidance
of transactions entirely.
@BeanA's behavior might differ depending on its implementation (throw exception or attempt to create a new top-level transaction).
Alternatives:
Re-evaluate @BeanA or @BeanB:
If @BeanA doesn't necessarily require a nested transaction, consider required on @BeanA (participates in existing or
starts a new one). This simplifies transaction management.
If @BeanB's logic truly doesn't require a transaction and its changes are isolated, not_supported might be suitable.
Explicit Transaction Management: If managing complex transactional behavior is crucial, consider explicitly managing
the transaction using a transaction manager. This allows you to define transaction boundaries more precisely and
potentially start a transaction before calling @BeanA (if needed for its nested transaction).

-----------------------
@BeanA (nested) --> @BeanB (nested):
@BeanA (nested):
Requires a surrounding transaction to create its own nested transaction.
@BeanB (nested):
Requires a surrounding transaction to create its own nested transaction.
Outcomes (depend on existing transaction):
Existing Transaction:
@BeanA Creates Nested Transaction: Within the context of the existing transaction, @BeanA can create its own nested transaction.
@BeanB Can Create Its Own Nested Transaction (potentially): Depending on @BeanA's implementation, it might create
its nested transaction before calling @BeanB. In this case, @BeanB can then potentially create its own nested
transaction within @BeanA's nested transaction, achieving deeper nesting levels.
No Existing Transaction:
Exception Likely: Both @BeanA and @BeanB likely throw exceptions due to the missing surrounding transaction required
for their nested transactions.
Important Points:
Nesting Levels: This scenario allows for potentially deeper nesting of transactions if an existing transaction exists.
Exception Prone without Existing Transaction: Without a surrounding transaction, both methods will likely fail due to
their nesting requirements.
Alternatives:
Consider Consistency Needs: Ensure both methods' logic doesn't unintentionally affect data also accessed by transactional
methods if exceptions occur due to missing transactions.
Re-evaluate Propagation Levels:
If @BeanA or @BeanB doesn't necessarily require a nested transaction, consider required on them (participates in existing
or starts a new one).
If specific nesting behavior is desired, consider explicit transaction management.
Explicit Transaction Management: If managing complex transactional behavior with precise nesting is crucial, consider
explicitly managing the transaction using a transaction manager. This allows you to define transaction boundaries more
precisely and potentially start a transaction before calling @BeanA to ensure it's available for its nested transaction.
