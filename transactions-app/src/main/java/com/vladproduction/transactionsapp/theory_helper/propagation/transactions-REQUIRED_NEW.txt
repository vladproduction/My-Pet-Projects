Context of transaction scenario, Spring will:
-----------------------
@BeanA (required_new) --> @BeanB (required):
@BeanA (required_new):
Regardless of any existing transaction:
Suspends the current transaction (if any).
Starts a new, independent transaction named "Transaction X" (or a newly generated name).
@BeanB (required):
Requires a surrounding transaction.
Here's the key point: Since @BeanA started a new transaction ("Transaction X"), @BeanB will not participate in it.
@BeanB will instead:
If another transaction exists besides "Transaction X" (unlikely in this scenario), it will participate in that existing
transaction.
If there's no other transaction besides "Transaction X" (the typical case), @BeanB will throw an exception because it
requires a transaction and none exists for it to participate in.
Essentially, this scenario creates a situation where @BeanA and @BeanB operate in separate transaction contexts.
Outcomes:
Changes made by @BeanA: These changes are isolated within the newly started "Transaction X". They will be committed
or rolled back based solely on the success of @BeanA.
Changes made by @BeanB:
If @BeanB throws an exception due to the missing transaction, no changes are made.
If another transaction exists besides "Transaction X" (unlikely), @BeanB might participate in and affect that other transaction.
Important points:
Use required_new on @BeanA with caution, especially if @BeanB also requires a transaction (required). This can lead to
isolation and potential exceptions in @BeanB.
Consider alternatives like requires_new on both methods if you need them to operate in completely independent transactions.
However, be mindful of potential data consistency issues if both methods modify the same data.
If @BeanA doesn't necessarily require a new transaction (but might start one), consider required on @BeanA and requires_new
on @BeanB (only if isolation is needed for @BeanB).
-----------------------
@BeanA (required_new) --> @BeanB (required_new):
@BeanA (required_new):
Regardless of any existing transaction:
Suspends the current transaction (if any).
Starts a new, independent transaction named "Transaction X" (or a newly generated name).
@BeanB (required_new):
Regardless of any existing transaction (including "Transaction X" from @BeanA):
Suspends "Transaction X" (if it even sees it).
Starts a new, independent transaction named "Transaction Y" (or a newly generated name).
Essentially, this scenario creates two completely independent transactions.
Outcomes:
Changes made by @BeanA: These changes are isolated within the newly started "Transaction X".
They will be committed or rolled back based solely on the success of @BeanA.
Changes made by @BeanB: These changes are isolated within the newly started "Transaction Y".
They will be committed or rolled back based solely on the success of @BeanB.
Important points:
This scenario creates complete isolation between @BeanA and @BeanB. Their successes or failures won't affect each other.
Use required_new on both methods cautiously, especially if they modify the same data. This can lead to data
inconsistency if one transaction commits and the other rolls back, resulting in partially updated data.
Consider alternatives:
If you only need @BeanB to be isolated, use required on @BeanA and required_new on @BeanB.
If both methods need independent transactions but data consistency is critical, re-evaluate your logic to see if a
single transaction with proper isolation levels within it might be a better approach.
-----------------------
@BeanA (required_new) --> @BeanB (mandatory):
@BeanA (required_new):
Regardless of any existing transaction:
Suspends the current transaction (if any).
Starts a new, independent transaction named "Transaction X" (or a newly generated name).
@BeanB (mandatory):
Requires a surrounding transaction.
Since @BeanA started a new transaction ("Transaction X") and then suspended it, @BeanB won't see this transaction
as "surrounding".
Outcome:
@BeanB (mandatory): Because @BeanB requires a transaction and there's none available for it to participate in
(both the original transaction and "Transaction X" are suspended), @BeanB will throw an exception.
Important points:
This scenario is likely to result in an exception in @BeanB due to the conflicting propagation levels.
Using required_new on @BeanA isolates it, and mandatory on @BeanB requires a transaction that might not exist.
Avoid this combination unless you have a very specific and well-understood reason for it.
Alternatives:
If @BeanA doesn't necessarily require a new transaction (but might start one), consider required on @BeanA and
requires_new on @BeanB (only if isolation is needed for @BeanB).
If @BeanA absolutely needs a new transaction and @BeanB also requires a transaction, explore alternative approaches
to ensure @BeanB can participate in a suitable transaction context. This might involve redesigning the logic or
using a transaction manager to explicitly manage the transaction hierarchy.
-----------------------
@BeanA (required_new) --> @BeanB (never):
@BeanA (required_new):
Regardless of any existing transaction:
Suspends the current transaction (if any).
Starts a new, independent transaction named "Transaction X" (or a newly generated name).
@BeanB (never):
Throws an exception if a surrounding transaction exists (including "Transaction X" from @BeanA).
Outcome:
@BeanA: Starts and operates within "Transaction X".
@BeanB: Throws an exception because never prevents it from executing within any transaction, including the newly
started "Transaction X".
Important points:
This scenario isolates @BeanB completely, but it also throws an exception in @BeanB.
Using required_new on @BeanA isolates its logic, while never on @BeanB prevents it from running within any transaction context.
Consider alternatives:
If @BeanA needs a new transaction and @BeanB doesn't require one (or should be non-transactional), you can
keep required_new on @BeanA and remove the transaction annotation from @BeanB.
If the goal is complete isolation for both methods but without the exception, this combination might not be ideal.
Explore alternative approaches to achieve isolation without preventing @BeanB from executing altogether.
-----------------------
@BeanA (required_new) --> @BeanB (supported):
@BeanA (required_new):
Regardless of any existing transaction:
Suspends the current transaction (if any).
Starts a new, independent transaction named "Transaction X" (or a newly generated name).
@BeanB (supported):
If another transaction exists besides "Transaction X" (unlikely in this scenario):
It will participate in that existing transaction.
If there's no other transaction besides "Transaction X":
@BeanB will execute non-transactional. This means any changes it makes to the database won't be part of "Transaction X".
Essentially, this scenario isolates @BeanA within its own transaction ("Transaction X"), while @BeanB executes
outside any transaction.
Outcomes:
Changes made by @BeanA: These changes are isolated within "Transaction X". They will be committed or rolled back based
solely on the success of @BeanA.
Changes made by @BeanB: These changes are independent of any transaction.
If @BeanB succeeds, its changes are committed to the database.
If @BeanB throws an exception, its changes aren't rolled back. They might still be reflected in the database, potentially
leading to data consistency issues.
Important points:
Use this scenario cautiously, especially if @BeanB modifies data also involved in the transaction started by @BeanA.
This separation can cause inconsistencies if @BeanA fails and @BeanB's changes remain unrolled back.
Consider alternatives:
If @BeanA needs a new transaction and @BeanB also requires a transaction context, use requires_new on @BeanB as well.
However, be mindful of potential data consistency issues if both methods modify the same data.
If @BeanA needs a new transaction but @BeanB can participate in any existing transaction (including the one potentially
started by @BeanA), consider required on @BeanA and supported on @BeanB.
-----------------------
@BeanA (required_new) --> @BeanB (not_supported):
@BeanA (required_new):
Regardless of any existing transaction:
Suspends the current transaction (if any).
Starts a new, independent transaction named "Transaction X" (or a newly generated name).
@BeanB (not_supported):
Suspends any existing transaction (including the newly started "Transaction X" from @BeanA).
Executes @BeanB non-transactional, meaning any changes it makes to the database won't be part of any transaction.
Essentially, this scenario isolates @BeanA within its own transaction ("Transaction X"), while also suspending
that transaction for @BeanB. This means @BeanB executes outside any transaction context.
Outcomes:
Changes made by @BeanA: These changes are isolated within "Transaction X". They will be committed or rolled back
based solely on the success of @BeanA.
Changes made by @BeanB: These changes are completely independent of any transaction.
If @BeanB succeeds, its changes are committed to the database.
If @BeanB throws an exception, its changes aren't rolled back. They might still be reflected in the database,
potentially leading to data consistency issues.
Important points:
Data Consistency Issues: This scenario is particularly prone to data consistency problems because not_supported on
@BeanB suspends the transaction started by @BeanA. If @BeanA fails and rolls back its changes, but @BeanB has already
made modifications, the database might end up in an inconsistent state.
Use this combination with extreme caution, especially if @BeanA and @BeanB modify the same data.
Alternatives:
If @BeanA needs a new transaction but @BeanB doesn't require one (or should be non-transactional), you can keep required_new
on @BeanA and remove the transaction annotation from @BeanB.
If @BeanA needs a new transaction and @BeanB also requires a transaction context, consider requires_new on both methods.
However, be mindful of potential data consistency issues if both methods modify the same data.
If the goal is to isolate @BeanA but still allow @BeanB to participate in a potential existing transaction
(excluding the one suspended by not_supported), you might need to redesign the logic or use a transaction manager to
manage the hierarchy more explicitly.
-----------------------
@BeanA (required_new) --> @BeanB (nested):
@BeanA (required_new):
Regardless of any existing transaction:
Suspends any current transaction (if there is one).
Starts a new, independent transaction named "Transaction X" (or a newly generated name).
@BeanB (nested):
Creates a nested transaction named "Transaction Y" within the context of "Transaction X".
This creates a nested structure, not a completely independent transaction.
This creates a parent-child transaction relationship:
Parent Transaction (Transaction X): Started by @BeanA using required_new.
Nested Transaction (Transaction Y): Started by @BeanB using nested.
Outcomes:
Changes made within Transaction Y: These changes are isolated within "Transaction Y".
If "Transaction Y" succeeds:
Its changes are committed only if "Transaction X" (the parent transaction) also succeeds.
If "Transaction Y" fails:
Its changes are rolled back, but "Transaction X" can still continue if it doesn't encounter other issues.
Changes made within Transaction X: Committed or rolled back independently of "Transaction Y".
Important points:
Isolation and Roll Back: Nested transactions provide a degree of isolation for @BeanB's logic, but their changes are
still tied to the success of the parent transaction (@BeanA).
Transaction Manager: If both methods involve database calls, ensure a suitable transaction manager is configured for
Spring to manage these nested transactions effectively.
