Context of transaction scenario, Spring will:
-----------------------
@BeanA (mandatory) --> @BeanB (required):
@BeanA (mandatory):
Requires a surrounding transaction.
If no transaction exists, it throws an exception.
@BeanB (required):
Requires a surrounding transaction.
Outcome:
Exception in @BeanB: Because @BeanA might throw an exception if no transaction exists, @BeanB might also encounter
an exception if it's called before @BeanA starts a transaction.
Important Points:
This scenario is prone to exceptions due to the strict requirements of both methods.
Using mandatory on @BeanA means it expects a pre-existing transaction, while required on @BeanB expects one as well
(either pre-existing or started by @BeanA).
Alternatives:
If @BeanA doesn't necessarily require an existing transaction (but might participate in one), consider:
required on @BeanA: This allows @BeanA to either start a new transaction or participate in an existing one.
requires_new on @BeanB: This isolates @BeanB within its own new transaction even if @BeanA doesn't start one.
(Use with caution if data consistency is critical.)
Additional Considerations:
If both methods absolutely require a transaction, and they need to be part of the same transaction, consider managing
the transaction explicitly using a transaction manager instead of relying solely on propagation levels.
-----------------------
@BeanA (mandatory) --> @BeanB (required_new):
@BeanA (mandatory):
Requires a surrounding transaction. If no transaction exists, it throws an exception.
@BeanB (required_new):
Regardless of any existing transaction (including the one potentially started by another method), starts a new,
independent transaction named "Transaction Y" (or a newly generated name).
Potential Outcomes:
Exception in @BeanA (likely): Since @BeanA requires a surrounding transaction, it might throw an exception if no
transaction exists before calling @BeanA.
Unexpected behavior: Even if there's an existing transaction:
@BeanA will participate in that existing transaction.
@BeanB will still create its own independent "Transaction Y". This can lead to data consistency issues if both methods
modify the same data.
Important Points:
This scenario is prone to exceptions and potential data consistency issues.
mandatory on @BeanA expects a pre-existing transaction, while required_new on @BeanB forces a new independent transaction
even if one exists.
Alternatives:
Avoid this combination unless there's a very specific and well-understood reason for it.
Consider alternative approaches based on your needs:
If @BeanA doesn't necessarily require a transaction but might participate in one, use required on @BeanA and requires_new
on @BeanB. This isolates @BeanB but comes with data consistency risks if both access the same data.
If both methods require a transaction but need to be isolated, consider managing the transaction explicitly using a
transaction manager. This gives you more control over the transaction hierarchy.
-----------------------
@BeanA (mandatory) --> @BeanB (mandatory):
@BeanA (mandatory):
Requires a surrounding transaction to participate in.
If no transaction exists, it throws an exception.
@BeanB (mandatory):
Also requires a surrounding transaction to participate in.
Outcome:
Exception: Because both methods require a pre-existing transaction, this scenario is likely to throw an exception if
no transaction is started before calling @BeanA.
Important points:
Exception prone: Both methods have strict requirements, making it difficult to use them together without proper transaction
management.
Alternatives:
Consider alternative approaches based on your needs:
If @BeanA can potentially start a transaction:
Use required on @BeanA: This allows @BeanA to either participate in an existing transaction or start a new one.
Keep mandatory on @BeanB: This ensures @BeanB participates in the same transaction (either the pre-existing one or the new
one started by @BeanA).
If both methods absolutely require a transaction:
Manage the transaction explicitly using a transaction manager. This gives you more control over starting and managing the
transaction before calling these methods.
-----------------------
@BeanA (mandatory) --> @BeanB (never):
@BeanA (mandatory):
Requires a surrounding transaction.
If no transaction exists, it throws an exception.
@BeanB (never):
Throws an exception if a surrounding transaction exists (including the one potentially started by @BeanA).
Outcome:
Exception in @BeanA: Since @BeanA requires a transaction, it will likely throw an exception because @BeanB (never)
prevents any transaction participation, including the one @BeanA might start.
Important points:
This scenario is designed to prevent @BeanB from executing within a transaction, but it also forces an exception in @BeanA.
Using mandatory on @BeanA indicates it expects a pre-existing transaction, while never on @BeanB disallows any transaction
involvement.
Alternatives:
Avoid this combination unless there's a very specific reason for it.
Consider alternative approaches based on your needs:
If @BeanA doesn't necessarily require a transaction but might participate in one, use required on @BeanA and remove the
transaction annotation from @BeanB. This allows @BeanB to run outside any transaction context.
If @BeanA absolutely requires a transaction but @BeanB shouldn't be transactional, keep mandatory on @BeanA and use
never on @BeanB. However, handle the potential exception from @BeanA gracefully.
-----------------------
@BeanA (mandatory) --> @BeanB (supported):
@BeanA (mandatory):
Requires a surrounding transaction.
If no transaction exists, it throws an exception.
@BeanB (supported):
If another transaction exists (including the one potentially started by @BeanA):
It will participate in that existing transaction.
If there's no other transaction:
@BeanB will execute non-transactional. This means any changes it makes to the database won't be part of any transaction.
Outcomes (depend on existing transaction):
Existing Transaction:
@BeanA participates in the existing transaction.
@BeanB also participates in the same existing transaction, benefiting from its transactional behavior (commit/rollback).
No Existing Transaction:
@BeanA throws an exception because it requires a transaction.
@BeanB (if not called before the exception) doesn't execute.
Important Points:
This scenario can be exception-prone due to mandatory on @BeanA.
If @BeanA successfully participates in an existing transaction, @BeanB benefits from the same transaction context.
If @BeanA needs to start a new transaction and @BeanB should also participate, consider alternatives like required on
@BeanA and requires_new on @BeanB (be mindful of data consistency).
Alternatives:
If @BeanA can potentially start a transaction:
Use required on @BeanA: This allows @BeanA to either participate in an existing transaction or start a new one.
Keep supported on @BeanB: This allows @BeanB to participate in the transaction if there is one (either pre-existing or
started by @BeanA).
Explicit Transaction Management:
If both methods require a transaction but specific control is needed, consider managing the transaction explicitly
using a transaction manager.
-----------------------
@BeanA (mandatory) --> @BeanB (not_supported):
@BeanA (mandatory):
Requires a surrounding transaction.
If no transaction exists, it throws an exception.
@BeanB (not_supported):
Suspends any existing transaction (including the one potentially started by @BeanA).
Executes @BeanB non-transactional, meaning any changes it makes are not part of any transaction.
Outcome (Exception in @BeanA):
Since @BeanA requires a transaction, it's likely to throw an exception because @BeanB (not_supported) suspends any
existing transaction (including the one @BeanA might start).
Important Points:
This scenario is not recommended due to the conflicting requirements.
mandatory on @BeanA expects a transaction, while not_supported on @BeanB actively prevents any transaction involvement.
Alternatives (Avoid This Scenario):
Re-evaluate your approach: This combination doesn't achieve a clear goal. Consider alternative approaches based on your needs:
If @BeanA can potentially start a transaction but @BeanB doesn't require one:
Use required on @BeanA (allows participation in existing or starts a new one).
Remove the transaction annotation from @BeanB (executes outside of any transaction).
If @BeanA absolutely requires a transaction but @BeanB shouldn't be transactional:
Keep mandatory on @BeanA.
Consider removing the transaction annotation from @BeanB (might still throw an exception in @BeanA). However,
handle the exception gracefully if necessary.
Explicit Transaction Management: If both methods require a transaction but with specific control, manage the
transaction explicitly using a transaction manager.
-----------------------
@BeanA (mandatory) --> @BeanB (nested):
@BeanA (mandatory):
Requires a surrounding transaction. If no transaction exists, it throws an exception.
@BeanB (nested):
Creates a nested transaction within the context of the surrounding transaction (started by @BeanA if necessary).
This creates a parent-child transaction relationship.
Potential Outcomes (depend on existing transaction):
Existing Transaction:
@BeanA participates in the existing transaction.
@BeanB creates a nested transaction within the existing one. Both methods benefit from the same overall transaction
context (commit/rollback).
No Existing Transaction:
Exception Likely: Since @BeanA requires a transaction, it might throw an exception if no transaction exists before calling it.
If @BeanA manages to start a new transaction:
@BeanB then creates a nested transaction within that newly started transaction.
Important Points:
This scenario can be exception-prone due to mandatory on @BeanA.
If a transaction exists (or @BeanA successfully starts one), both methods participate in a transaction hierarchy (parent-child).
Alternatives:
Consider requires_new on both if isolation is critical:
If both methods absolutely require a transaction and complete isolation from any existing transaction, use requires_new
on both @BeanA and @BeanB. However, be mindful of potential data consistency issues if both methods modify the same data.
Explicit Transaction Management:
If you need more control over the transaction hierarchy or have specific requirements, consider managing the
transaction explicitly using a transaction manager.
